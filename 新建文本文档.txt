-          Delete all ATI folders in C:\programs files and C:\programs files (x86)
-          Go to C:\Windows\assembly and sort by "Public Key Token". Locate the following Public Key Token "90ba9c70f846762e" that is
-          associated with ATI. Usually only 2 entries. Delete the 2 entries. Note: the entries should be deleted (right click and choose uninstall) in safemode since regular
-          mode may result in a permissions error. The 2 entries only show up in systems affected by this issue. This means that searching for the 2 entries on systems where CCC loads, the entries are not there.
-      Shut down and re-start normally.
-          Reinstall the ATI Catalyst package with driver/ccc bundle from here:
